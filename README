= kiva -- wrapper to the kiva rest API

You can find more information about the API here[http://developers.wiki.kiva.org/KivaAPI]

== Installing

You have to deal with this yourself. Everything seems to work, but it still needs to be
tested and gemified, made beautiful and all the other boring stuff.



== Mailing List

In case you discover bugs, spelling errors, offer suggestions for
improvements or would like to help out with the project, you can contact
me directly (tim@kuriositaet.de).
