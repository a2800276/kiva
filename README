= kiva -- wrapper to the kiva rest API

This is a wrapper to the Kiva Web API. You can find more information
about the API here[http://developers.wiki.kiva.org/KivaAPI].


== Example

The following is an example of retrieving the last 20 loans on Kiva.
This is about as difficult as things get:

    require 'kiva'
    
    newest = Kiva::Loan.load_newest
    newest.each{ |loan|
      puts "#{loan.name} loaned $#{loan.funded_amount} for
			#{loan.activity} in #{loan.location["country"]}"
    }

Running the above script yields something similar to the following:

    $ ruby -rubygems examples/newest.rb 

    Angela Okosun loaned $225 for Cement in Nigeria
    Vitaliy Konovalenko loaned $1650 for Retail in Ukraine
		(...)
    Thi Thoa Do's Group loaned $300 for Food Production/Sales in Viet Nam
    Thi Hoa Nguyen loaned $900 for General Store in Viet Nam


== Prerequisites

Kiva doesn't require an account or an API key in order to use their API,
so there are no prerequisites to using it. This library does depend on
SimpleHTTP[http://simplehttp.rubyforge.org/] and
json[http://json.rubyforge.org/] to handle the web api. These should be
installed automatically if you used +gem+ to install the library, else,
you'll need to install them manually.


== Basic Usage

This library consists of number of classes modelling the data
objects which the web api returns. Each class is similar, consisting of
class methods used to call webapi functions and attributes which provide
access to the (unpacked) json data the webapi returns.

These classes are (in no particular order) :

* <code>Kiva::Loan</code>
* <code>Kiva::Lender</code>
* <code>Kiva::LendingAction</code>
* <code>Kiva::Partner</code>
* <code>Kiva::JournalEntry</code>
* <code>Kiva::Comment</code>
* <code>Kiva::Release</code>

Each of these classes has attributes containing the data returned from
the web api. For example, a +Comment+ has the attributes:

* <code>author</code>
* <code>body</code>
* <code>date</code>
* <code>id</code>
* <code>whereabouts</code>

Each class has one or more class methods, corresponding to web api
calls, which may be used to create and load instances of the class. For
example, +Loan+ has the following list of class methods:

* +load+ : loans/&lt;ids&gt;[http://developers.wiki.kiva.org/KivaAPI#loans/ltidsgt]
* +load_for_lender+ : loans/&lt;id&gt;/lenders[http://developers.wiki.kiva.org/KivaAPI#loans/ltidgt/lenders]
* +load_newest+ : loans/newest[http://developers.wiki.kiva.org/KivaAPI#loans/newest]
* +search+ : loans/search[http://developers.wiki.kiva.org/KivaAPI#loans/search]
